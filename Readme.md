# Arduino Beat Detector





It detects a beat in a line level audio signal.

I use this repository to save the original work from Damian Peckett because the [website](http://damian.pecke.tt/cinnamon-lessons-learnt-from-launching-a-kickstarter-product) is not reachable anymore.

Code can be found in the [pdf](Beat-Detection-On-The-Arduino.pdf) or in the folder /main.

Big Thanks to [Damian](https://github.com/dpeckett) for his awesome work & article!
